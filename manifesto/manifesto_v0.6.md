## PREAMBLE

Untitled Department is a hybrid workshop.
A physical place and a digital environment.
A forge for objects, systems, and ideas.

It is not an institution.
It is not a brand in search of scale.
It is a place where work happens. 

We operate as a guild — not bound by tradition, but grounded in craft. Each member works with different materials, yet all share the same responsibility: to understand what they are making, and why it exists.  

Here, metal is shaped. Textiles are assembled. Electronics are soldered. Code is written. Design is tested against reality.

This is not a space for finished statements. It is a space for construction.


## PURPOSE

Our purpose is to create conditions for making. Not outcomes. Not products alone. But the process that allows them to emerge.

We study how things are built — by hand, by machine, by system. We treat making as research and research as a form of craft.

We are interested in material intelligence: how metal resists, how fabric behaves, how circuits fail, how software adapts.

Technology is not separate from craft. It is its current form.

We work with machines and AI as tools, assistants, co-authors, and provocateurs. They challenge decisions, expose shortcuts, and force clarity where intuition is vague.

We do not design for trends.
We do not optimize for polish.
We do not pursue scale for its own sake.

We value awareness over efficiency.
Understanding over acceleration.

## METHOD

Our method is grounded in work.

We prototype early and break often. We accept errors as part of the system. We move slowly when necessary and unpredictably when required.

Every version matters. Every iteration leaves a trace. Nothing is erased — only revised.

We document as we go, not to explain ourselves, but to remember how things came to be.

We work across disciplines because problems do not respect boundaries.

The workshop is loud: tools, keyboards, conversations. Ideas are discussed, challenged, rebuilt.

This is not a clean process. It is a real one.

## THE WORKSHOP

The workshop is the core.

It is a place of assembly, testing, and failure. It is also a place of exchange — between people, disciplines, and machines.

In time, it becomes visible to others: through objects, through documentation, through a store that functions as an archive, a continuation of the workshop rather than its endpoint.

What is sold is not perfection, but a snapshot of a process.

## DECLARATION

Untitled Department is officially unofficial.

We have no hierarchy, only responsibility. No titles, only roles defined by action. No final versions, only current states.

We do not promise clarity. We promise honesty in making.

This is a place where things are built, tested, and questioned. A place where systems and materials meet. A place where **we create.**

Filed under: *experimental craft*.
Operating as a guild.
Working in public, selectively.  
**looping since 2025.**
