## PREAMBLE

Untitled Department is a hybrid workshop.
A physical space and a digital system.

Metal is shaped.
Textile is assembled.
Electronics are soldered.
Code is written.

Different materials.
One process.

We are not an institution.
We are not trend-driven.
We are not optimized for scale.

We build to understand.


## PURPOSE

Our purpose is to study how things are constructed.

How an idea becomes structure.
How structure becomes object.
How object becomes system.

We work across material and computational domains.
Matter and logic are not separate fields.

Technology is not decoration.
It is structure.

AI is not mythology.
It is part of the workflow —
assistant, instrument, co-author, constraint.

We do not chase polish.
We value clarity in process.

## METHOD

We prototype early.
We test often.
We break systems and rebuild them.

Every version matters.
Nothing disappears — it evolves.

We document not to explain,
but to track how things were made.

Process over trend.
Iteration over spectacle.
Understanding over speed.


## DECLARATION

Untitled Department is officially unofficial.

No hierarchy.
No final state.
Only current versions.

A place where material and system meet.
A place where things are constructed.

A place where созидается.

Operating in public. Selectively.
Since 2025.
